				<p>
					An empty Gitpod workspace with no code comes pre-installed with many common developer tools including Git, Node, Java, and Go. These can be difficult for students to install themselves, especially when your instruction may be based on a specific version.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many scripts run differently on Mac, Windows, and Linux, but since Gitpod runs everything in a Linux container, students are guaranteed a consistent experience no matter what device they use.
				</p>

		{
			title: 'Do users get their own workspaces? How does collaboration work?',
			content: `
				<p>
					When a user starts a Gitpod workspace, they get their own unique clone of the developer environment where they can code independently.
				</p>
				<p>
					Users can share their workspace to allow others to access their dev environment exactly as they do, which can allow instructors to help students directly.
				</p>
				<p>
					Alternatively, collaboration features like VS Code Live Share still work with Gitpod.
				</p>
			`,
		},
		{
			title: 'How well does Gitpod work on unstable (eg: hotels/conferences) connections?',
			content: `
				<p>
					Gitpod workspaces actually often require less bandwidth than local development because dependencies and SDKs stay in the cloud instead of being downloaded to your local machine.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is some overhead of a persistent connection, with your IDE operating as a thin client communicating with Gitpod, but the remote development features in VS Code and JetBrains Gateway are designed to be resilient with unstable connections and reconnecting automatically.
