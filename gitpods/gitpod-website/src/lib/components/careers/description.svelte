			Make software engineering collaborative and joyful again.
		</h2>
		<p>
			Developers write software within languages/frameworks, build tools,
			glue them together to (tool) chains, develop against APIs and
			communicate and collaborate with our colleagues. All of that should
			be efficient, joyful and secure.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			But it isn’t. Devs constantly struggle with larger codebases,
			cluttered dependencies, security policies and unnecessary friction
			in their workflows. We want to empower developers and empower them
			to code.

			Gitpod was founded because we were frustrated by manually setting up
			and maintaining dev environments.
		</h2>
		<p>
			We are building Gitpod in the open to easily spin-up fresh dev
			environments for any task. Those ephemeral environments are fast &
			powerful, fully automated & initialized. They empower developers to
			immediately start coding, debugging, and testing their code.

		<p>

			product, our company and our brand: no hurdles, no BS, no
			unnecessary extra steps.
		</p>
		<br />

		<p>
			We are fully remote and globally distributed. You can work from
			anywhere and work a schedule that fits you best.
		</p>
		<br />

		<p>
			We celebrate diversity and strive for an equal, inclusive,
			empathetic and welcoming environment. We are currently not as
			diverse as we would like to be, but are actively working to build a
			more diverse and inclusive team.
