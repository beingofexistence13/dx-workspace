Gitpod uses the public [OpenVSX](https://open-vsx.org) registry as only products produced by Microsoft may access the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. This document explains how Gitpod Self-Hosted can be configured in air-gapped scenarios to connect to a private OpenVSX registry.

## Configuration

To connect to private OpenVSX registry, perform the following steps:

1.  Merge the following into your `values.custom.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    components:
        openVsxProxy:
            vsxRegistryUrl: open-vsx.org
    ```

    Replace `open-vsx.org` with the domain your registry is available at.

2.  Do a `helm upgrade --install -f values.custom.yaml gitpod gitpod.io/gitpod --version=0.10.0` to apply the changes.
