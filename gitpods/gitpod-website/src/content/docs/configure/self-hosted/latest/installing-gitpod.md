# Installing Gitpod Self-Hosted

> ⚠️ **Gitpod Self-hosted is [no longer supported](/blog/introducing-gitpod-dedicated)**
>
> The last update of Gitpod Self-hosted product was [November 2022](/changelog/november-self-hosted-release). Users can still request our [free community license](/community-license) however there will be no support or updates to the product. If you are interested in an isolated, private installation of Gitpod, take a look at [Gitpod Dedicated](/dedicated).

> **Note:** Setting up a self-hosted Gitpod instance needs some Kubernetes experience. Detailed guidance on how to setup and maintain a Kubernetes cluster is behind the scope of these docs. Please also see the [_prerequisites_](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/installing-gitpod#prerequisites) below.

## Prerequisites

> These prerequisites are fulfilled already if you used one of the [reference architectures](./reference-architecture). We strongly encourage the use of these reference architectures. Please see the [requirements](./requirements) for more information on what Gitpod needs to function.

<details>
  <summary  class="text-p-medium"><b> Kubernetes Cluster</b></summary>

Gitpod is a Kubernetes application that uses Kubernetes internally to provision workspaces as Kubernetes pods. Before you can start installing Gitpod, you need to create a compatible Kubernetes cluster. The [reference architectures](./reference-architecture) will help you to get started with your favorite cloud provider. If you are creating a cluster yourself, it's up to you to set up a cluster that meets the [requirements](./requirements).

</details>

<details>
  <summary  class="text-p-medium"><b>Cert-Manager installed on the cluster</b></summary>

Once you have created your Kubernetes cluster you need to install [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/). cert-manager is needed even when you bring your own TLS certificate for your domain. Please consider the [cert-manager documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) on how to install it.

</details>

<details>
  <summary  class="text-p-medium"><b>DNS and TLS configured</b></summary>

To install Gitpod you need a domain with a TLS certificate. The DNS setup to your domain needs to be configured such that it points to the ingress of your Kubernetes cluster. You need to configure your actual domain (say `example.com`) as well as the wildcard subdomains `*.example.com` and `*.ws.example.com`. Alternatively, you can rely on a configured `Issuer`/`ClusterIssuer` plus a `Certificate` (that also includes the wildcard domains) for cert-manager:

**Creating TLS certs for your domain with cert-manager**

cert-manager provides the Gitpod installation with certificates for internal communication. Besides this, cert-manager can also create a TLS certificate for your domain. Since Gitpod needs wildcard certificates, you must use the [DNS-01 challenge](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge). Please consult the [cert-manager documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01) for instructions. You can use either an [`Issuer` or `ClusterIssuer`](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/issuer).

Following the cert-manager instructions, you will have an `Issuer` or `ClusterIssuer` with a configured `dns01` solver (most probably with a proper secret with credentials for your DNS provider) as well a `Certificate` with the following `dnsNames`:

-   `example.com`
-   `*.example.com`
-   `*.ws.example.com`

_(replace `example.com` with your Gitpod domain)_

</details>

## Install Gitpod

To start with installing Gitpod, you need a terminal where you can run `kubectl` against your cluster. First, install the KOTS kubectl plugin:

```shell
curl https://kots.io/install | bash
```

Now, you are ready to install Gitpod. Run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
kubectl kots install gitpod
```

You will be asked for the namespace you want to install Gitpod to as well as a password for the admin console. After some time, you will see the following output:

```
  • Press Ctrl+C to exit
  • Go to http://localhost:8800 to access the Admin Console
```

Open your favorite browser and go to `http://localhost:8800` (port `8800` is opened on your node on `localhost` only--you may want to forward the port to your workstation in order to access the admin console).

The first page will ask you to upload your Gitpod license which you can get [here](/community-license) For more information about our licenses and respective pricing plans, please visit our [self-hosted pricing page](https://www.gitpod.io/self-hosted).

After uploading the license, you will be forwarded to the config page. On this page, you need to enter your domain name for your Gitpod installation. You can also configure to use [external components](./requirements) (by default internal ones are installed) as well as your TLS certs setup or your [workspace size](./configuring-workspace-resources). Click “Continue” to proceed with the installation.

In the next step, the installer runs a preflight check. This validates your cluster meets the minimum requirements. Everything is green? Awesome! Click “Continue” to proceed.

![kots-preflights-results](/images/docs/self-hosted/kots-preflights-results.png)

Now, you are seeing the installation admin page. Once the installation has been finished successfully, you will see the status “Ready” with a small green indicator next to the Gitpod logo. You will also see which version you installed and which license you are using.

![kots-admin-dashboard](/images/docs/self-hosted/kots-admin-dashboard.png)

Open your Gitpod domain in your browser to access your running Gitpod instance. You should be greeted by the following screen:

![welcome screen](/images/docs/self-hosted/welcome-screen.png)

You will then be asked to configure a git integration:

![git integration setup](/images/docs/self-hosted/git-integration-setup.png)

This git integration will also serve as the way that you and your users get authenticated against your Gitpod installation. You can find out more in the [Integrations](/docs/integrations) section.

> **Important:** Public (SaaS) Source Control Management Systems (SCMs) (i.e. [GitLab.com](http://Gitlab.com), [GitHub.com](http://github.com/) and [Bitbucket.org](http://Bitbucket.org)) are **not** integrated by default with a Self-Hosted Gitpod instance because OAuth apps are tied to domains. Therefore, these public SCMs need to be integrated manually with an OAuth application you specifically create for your domain. This is done similarly to how it is done for the private/self-hosted versions of each SCM. As such their respective guides also apply here:
>
> -   Follow [these](/docs/configure/authentication/gitlab#registering-a-self-hosted-gitlab-installation) steps to integrate [`GitLab.com`](https://gitlab.com/) with your self-hosted Gitpod instance. You will need to enter `gitlab.com` as the `Provider Host Name` in the New Git Integration Modal.
> -   Follow [these](/docs/configure/authentication/github-enterprise) steps to integrate [`GitHub.com`](http://github.com) with your self-hosted Gitpod instance. You will need to enter `github.com` as the `Provider Host Name` in the New Git Integration Modal.
> -   Follow [these](/docs/configure/authentication/bitbucket-server) steps to integrate [`Bitbucket.org`](https://bitbucket.org/) with your self-hosted Gitpod instance. Select `Bitbucket` as the `Provider Type` in the New Git Integration Modal. For bitbucket.org this requires configuring an "OAuth consumer" on a "workspace". This is slightly different from the documented Bitbucket Server integration. See [gitpod PR #9894](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/9894#pullrequestreview-969013833) for an example.

> **Note:** Your first workspace start can take a bit of time because the workspace image first needs to be built and then downloaded. Subsequent workspace starts should be much quicker.

Once you are all set up, you can visit the [getting started with Gitpod page](/docs/introduction/getting-started) to start learning about using Gitpod. You should also familiarise yourself with our [guides around operating Gitpod Self-Hosted](./operational-guides), especially the guide that explains [how to update Gitpod](./updating).
