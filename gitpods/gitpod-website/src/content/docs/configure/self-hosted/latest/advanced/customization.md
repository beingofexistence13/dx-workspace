# Applying custom annotations, labels and environment variables

> ⚠️ **Gitpod Self-hosted is [no longer supported](/blog/introducing-gitpod-dedicated)**
>
> The last update of Gitpod Self-hosted product was [November 2022](/changelog/november-self-hosted-release). Users can still request our [free community license](/community-license) however there will be no support or updates to the product. If you are interested in an isolated, private installation of Gitpod, take a look at [Gitpod Dedicated](/dedicated).

In this guide, we expect you to have a cluster up and running that [meets the requirements](../requirements) and has the [required components](../requirements) installed and configured (at least cert-manager is needed).

This guide assumes that you are using our default installation method from our [installation guide](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/installing-gitpod).

## Rationale

There are times when it is necessary to add custom annotations, environment variables and labels to your installation in order to add it to your environment. For example, one may need to support specific monitoring and observability software or want to target a specific load balancer type.

## Configuration

Before you start, you will need to create a YAML file that is subsequently used to describe your customizations. The structure is based upon the standard Kubernetes resource definition.

Once created, this file can be uploaded to the Installation Admin UI during installation under the advanced features section (bottom).

### Annotations and labels

For these to be applied to a resource, these must match the `apiVersion`, `kind` and `metadata.name` properties of the target resource. These accept any value that is valid as per the Kubernetes specifications and also an `*` as a wildcard.

Any properties in `metadata.annotations` and `metadata.labels` are then applied to the matching resource(s). These are key/value maps, where both key and value are strings.

**IMPORTANT** You cannot directly customize the properties on a `Pod`. Instead, these will inherit the annotation/label customization from its parent (`Deployment`, `DaemonSet`, `StatefulSet`, `Job` etc).

### Environment variables

For environment variables, these must match `metadata.name`. `apiVersion` and `kind` are ignored as these are only implemented on resources with containers.

Any properties in `spec.env` are then applied. These should have a `name` and `value` as per the Kubernetes specification.

## Example Configuration

```yaml
customization:
    - apiVersion: '*'
      kind: '*'
      metadata:
          name: '*'
          annotations:
              appliedToAll: value
              hello: world
          labels:
              appliedToAll: value
              hello: world
    - apiVersion: 'apps/v1'
      kind: 'Deployment'
      metadata:
          name: 'ws-manager'
          annotations:
              hello: ws-manager
          labels:
              hello: ws-manager
      spec:
          env:
              - name: HELLO
                value: world
```

This example would generate the following spec (these are simplified for readability reasons):

```yaml
---
# apps/v1/DaemonSet ws-daemon
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
    labels:
        app: gitpod # system-value
        component: ws-daemon # system-value
        appliedToAll: value
        hello: world
    annotations:
        appliedToAll: value
        hello: world
    name: ws-daemon
---
# apps/v1/Deployment ws-manager
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
    labels:
        app: gitpod
        component: ws-manager
        appliedToAll: value
        hello: ws-manager
    annotations:
        appliedToAll: value
        hello: ws-manager
    name: ws-manager
spec:
    template:
        # The custom annotations/labels are inherited from the Deployment spec
        metadata:
            annotations:
                appliedToAll: value
                gitpod.io/checksum_config: xxxx
                hello: ws-manager
            labels:
                app: gitpod
                component: ws-manager
                appliedToAll: value
                hello: ws-manager
            name: ws-manager
        spec:
            containers:
                - env:
                      - name: HELLO
                        value: world
```

In the event of multiple matches, the final matching customization is applied. Therefore, it is a good idea to structure your customization from least to most specific.

> **Important:** System-generated values will never be overridden.

## AWS Proxy Service Example

This is an example configuration for working with [AWS Load Balancer Controllers](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.4/) of the [Network Load Balancer](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.4/guide/service/nlb/) variety, when deployed in [AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/). This example creates a load balancer with a public IP, references two subnets: `[subnet-012e8ff1de0654321,subnet-0a6d28629bc123456]`, tunes timeouts, and ensures the tags `project:gitpod-docs` and `team:cs` are applied to the AWS resources it creates.

```yaml
---
customization:
    - apiVersion: '*'
      kind: 'Service'
      metadata:
          name: 'proxy'
          annotations:
              service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme: 'internet-facing'
              service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-nlb-target-type: 'instance'
              service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-subnets: 'subnet-012e8ff1de0654321,subnet-0a6d28629bc123456'
              alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/load-balancer-attributes: 'idle_timeout.timeout_seconds=3600'
              service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-additional-resource-tags: 'project=gitpod-docs,team=cs'
```

## Limitations

> This limitation has been removed as of [`2022.08.0`](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/releases/tag/2022.08.0).

Labels are immutable on some Kubernetes resources, such as `Deployments`, `DaemonSets` and `StatefulSets`.

If you wish to change a label on one of these resources, you must destroy that resource first. This can be achieved by running `kubectl delete <resource> --namespace <namespace> <name>` prior to running the KOTS deployment.

In the event of there being multiple resources that need to be amended, you can run `helm uninstall --namespace <namespace> gitpod`. If you are using an in-cluster database or object storage, you should not run this command without taking a backup of your persistent volumes first.

> **WARNING:** If deleting Kubernetes resources, your Gitpod instance is likely to become inaccessible and unstable. This should not be attempted while it is being used for normal development as data loss is likely.
