# Multi-repo

> Multi-Repo is currently in [Beta](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/8623).

If your software project is comprised of multiple source control repositories it is possible to configure Gitpod to clone these additional repositories through the configuration keys of `additionalRepositories` and `mainConfiguration` in the [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) file which removes the need to run multiple workspaces, and makes it easier to configure services which need to be aware of each other.

## Cloning additional repositories

The `additionalRepositories` key is an array of repositories which contains two properties which define the source control `url` to clone and the `checkoutLocation` of where the repository is cloned is under `/workspaces`

```yml
# example .gitpod.yml from https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-multi-repo-frontend
additionalRepositories:
    - url: https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-multi-repo-backend
      # checkoutLocation is relative to /workspaces
      checkoutLocation: backend
```

When the above configuration is defined then the following additional steps happen when Gitpod workspace is started:

1. If you open a workspace on a branch, Gitpod will clone the same-named branch in all repositories. If such a branch doesn’t exist Gitpod checks out the default branch.
1. The contents of `https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-multi-repo-frontend` is cloned to `/workspaces/demo-multi-repo-frontend`
1. The contents of `https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-multi-repo-backend` is cloned to `/workspaces/backend`

After all of the source control repositories have been cloned then the `before`, `init` and `command` [tasks](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks) are executed as per normal. If you need to run commands (such as package installation or compilation) on the source control repositories which have been cloned then change your working directory the `checkoutLocation` location using the `before` task.

```yml
# example .gitpod.yml from https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-multi-repo-frontend
additionalRepositories:
    - url: https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-multi-repo-backend
      checkoutLocation: backend

tasks:
    - name: backend
      # change working directory as per configured in `checkoutLocation`
      # which is configured above as `/workspaces/backend`
      before: |
          cd ../backend
      init: |
          echo npm install
      command: |
          echo npm run dev

      # changing of working directory is not required as these tasks will
      # by default by executed in `/workspaces/demo-multi-repo-frontend`
    - name: frontend
      init: |
          echo npm install
          echo npm run build
      command: |
          echo npm run dev
```

## Delegating configuration

The optional `mainConfiguration` configuration key when configured in additional repositories points to the repository with the main [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) file and makes it possible to open the same workspace from any issue, branch or other context URL from any of the participating repositories. Since the main configuration is used for prebuilds, those will show up under the main project.

```yml
# example .gitpod.yml from https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-multi-repo-backend
mainConfiguration: https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-multi-repo-frontend
```

## Adding additional repo folders to VS Code Explorer

![VS Code workspace folders](/images/docs/vscode-workspace-folders.png)

You might want to see the [`additionalRepositories`](#cloning-additional-repositories) on your VS Code.

To do so:

1. Create a file called `main.code-workspace` (for example) on your main(e.g. frontend) repository that everyone is expected to open via Gitpod.
2. Now you can define the folder paths:

```json
{
	// All paths are relative to your main repo
	// The additional repos are cloned inside /workspace dir
	"folders": [
		{
			"path": "." // Main repo that you will open in Gitpod (e.g. frontend)
		},
		{
			"path": "../backend" // Additional repo
		},
		{
			"path": "../db" // Additional repo
		}
	]
}
```

3. Specify your `.code-workspace` file path on `.gitpod.yml`:

```yml
workspaceLocation: frontend/main.code-workspace # Relative to /workspace dir
```

4. [Validate your configuration changes](/docs/configure/workspaces#validate-your-gitpod-configuration) by running `gp validate` in your workspace.
5. [Apply your .gitpod.yml changes](/docs/configure/workspaces#apply-configuration-changes) by committing and restarting a new workspace.

## FAQs

### [Single repo but instances of multiple branches](https://discord.com/channels/816244985187008514/1063202039955476540)

<!-- DISCORD_BOT_FAQ - DO NOT REMOVE -->

If you want to create multiple instances of one repository with different branches, you could use such a method:

```yml
tasks:
    - name: Multi branch
      before: |
          # Get primary repo dir path and name
          main_repo_dir="${GITPOD_REPO_ROOT}"
          primary_repo_name="${main_repo_dir##*/}"

          # Array for BRANCH name(s).
          extra_clone_branches=(
              backend
              docs
              next
          )

          for reference in "${extra_clone_branches[@]}"; do {
              dir="${main_repo_dir}-${reference}"

              if test ! -e "${dir}" && git -C "${main_repo_dir}" show-ref --quiet "refs/heads/${reference}"; then {
                printf 'INFO: %s\n' "Duplicating ${primary_repo_name} to ${dir} with ${reference} branch"
                cp -ra "${main_repo_dir}" "${dir}"
                git -C "${dir}" checkout "${reference}" 2>&1 | grep -v "Switched to branch '${reference}'"
              } fi
          } done

          # Send signal to awaiting task(s)
          gp sync-done multi_branch

    - name: Some other task
      command: |
          # Wait for multi_branch to avoid race condition
          gp sync-await multi_branch

          echo hello
          true 'something'
```
