# SSH

Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) is the basis for connecting to your Gitpod workspace when using [VS Code Desktop](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode), [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway), or accessing via the [command-line](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/command-line) from a local machine.

See [command-line](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/command-line) editors & IDEs documentation for more.

### Installing a supported SSH client

How to install a local SSH client depending on your operating system.

| OS                                        | Instructions                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows 10 1803+ / Server 2016/2019 1803+ | Install the [Windows OpenSSH Client](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse). |
| Earlier Windows                           | Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).                                                                     |
| macOS                                     | Comes pre-installed.                                                                                                             |
| Debian / Ubuntu / Mint                    | Run `sudo apt-get install openssh-client`                                                                                        |
| RHEL / Fedora / CentOS                    | Run `sudo yum install openssh-clients`                                                                                           |
| Arch / Manjaro                            | Comes pre-installed.                                                                                                             |

### Create an SSH key

Check to see if you already have an SSH key on your **local** machine. The key is typically located at `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` on macOS / Linux, and the `.ssh` directory in your user profile folder on Windows (for example `C:\Users\your-user\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub`).

If you do not have a key, run the following command in a **local** terminal / PowerShell to generate an SSH key pair:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

You will then be prompted to enter a secure passphrase, but you can leave that blank. You should now have a `id_ed25519.pub` file which contains your new public SSH key.

> **Note**: If you are using a legacy system that doesn't support the Ed25519 algorithm, you can use rsa instead: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`

> **Tip:** Don't have `ssh-keygen`? Install [a supported SSH client](#installing-a-supported-ssh-client).

### SSH file and folder permissions

**macOS / Linux:**

On your local machine, make sure the following permissions are set:

| Folder / File                             | Permissions                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `.ssh` in your user folder                | `chmod 700 ~/.ssh`                |
| `.ssh/config` in your user folder         | `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config`         |
| `.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` in your user folder | `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` |
| Any other key file                        | `chmod 600 /path/to/key/file`     |

**Windows:**

The specific expected permissions can vary depending on the exact SSH implementation you are using. We recommend using the out of box [Windows 10 OpenSSH Client](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_overview).

In this case, make sure that all of the files in the `.ssh` folder for your remote user on the SSH host is owned by you and no other user has permissions to access it. See the [Windows OpenSSH wiki](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Security-protection-of-various-files-in-Win32-OpenSSH) for details.

For all other clients, consult your client's documentation for what the implementation expects.

### Upload an SSH key to Gitpod

Once you've created an SSH key pair, you can upload your public SSH key to Gitpod, by navigating to [gitpod.io/keys](https://gitpod.io/keys) where you can upload one or more public SSH keys.

![SSH page of the Gitpod dashboard](/images/docs/ssh-key-upload-light-theme.png)

Paste your public key, and give your key a memorable title so that you can remember the name of the public key later if you choose to add multiple keys, e.g. "Gitpod Bastion Host SSH Key"

### Edit an SSH key in Gitpod

Gitpod doesn't support editing an SSH key.

To update an SSH key, delete the key and re-upload the SSH key to Gitpod.

### Delete an SSH key from Gitpod

To delete an SSH key, click the kebab menu to the right of the SSH key in the dashboard and select "delete".

## SSH Gateway

SSH Gateway facilitates connection via SSH for direct SSH access using uploaded public keys, and using the workspace owner token. Both the [VS Code Desktop](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode) and [JetBrains](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway) integrations use SSH Gateway to connect to Gitpod workspaces.

### What is SSH Gateway?

SSH Gateway is an intermediary service within Gitpod that proxies incoming SSH requests to the appropriate running workspaces.

### SSH Gateway in Self-Hosted

If you are running a [Self-Hosted](https://www.gitpod.io/self-hosted) Gitpod installation, you will need to ensure that:

1. The installation has the SSH Gateway component configured and deployed
2. Your networking and firewalls are configured to allow SSH traffic via port `22`.

See the [Self-Hosted Reference Architectures](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/reference-architecture) for more.

# Troubleshooting

[VS Code Desktop and SSH explained](/blog/vscode-desktop-ssh-updates#diagnosing--fixing-common-ssh-connection-issues) blog has a bunch of good troubleshooting notes, you may check them out.

## unix_listener: path "/somewhere/xyz" too long for Unix domain socket

-   Open your SSH `config` file in a text editor. (i.e. `~/.ssh/config` or `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`[[1](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/config)])
-   Append the following to it:

```
Host *.gitpod.io
     ControlPath /tmp/%r-gitpod
```

-   Save the file.
-   Now try connecting via SSH or VS Code Desktop again.
