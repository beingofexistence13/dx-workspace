# Browser Settings

For the best experience when working with Gitpod, we recommend you whitelist the `.gitpod.io` domain in your browser for the following permissions:

-   Paste content from your clipboard to a Gitpod workspace
-   Pop-ups, to preview your dev server in a new tab

Each browser handles this slightly differently:

-   [Chrome](#chrome)
-   [Edge](#edge)
-   [Brave](#brave)
-   [Firefox](#firefox)
-   [Safari](#safari)
