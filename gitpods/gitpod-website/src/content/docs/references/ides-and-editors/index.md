# IDEs & Editors

In line with [our ambition to "remove all friction from the developer experience"](https://www.notion.so/gitpod/Values-Attributes-2ed4c2f93c84499b98e3b5389980992e), Gitpod currently supports many popular IDE/editors e.g. JetBrains and VS Code through both the browser and on desktop. You can even use the command-line directly for editors like Vim (via SSH). There are many ways to configure your IDE/editor in Gitpod to match your preferred workflow or setup.

## Connecting an IDE/editor to Gitpod

The three main ways to edit code or access a Gitpod workspace:

1. **Browser** - Using [VS Code Browser](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode-browser).
2. **SSH** - Using an [SSH key](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/command-line#ssh-key-access) or an [Access Token](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/command-line#access-token-ssh).
3. **Desktop** - Using [VS Code Desktop](ides-and-editors/vscode) or [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway).

You can start a workspace with your favourite IDE/editor directly from [Gitpod Dashboard](https://gitpod.io/workspaces). You can do that from by clicking on the `New Workspace` button. Then, you can select the [context url](/docs/introduction/learn-gitpod/context-url), Editor and custom [workspace class](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-classes).
