# Contribute Documentation

Gitpod has a dedicated team that looks after our documentation. You can help improve our documentation by:

-   Using the feedback widget at the bottom of each page in our documentation. All feedback is recorded into a spreadsheet and we use this information to drive the process to improve the Gitpod documentation.
-   Submitting documentation updates via the "Edit on Gitpod button" (top right on every page) when you learn something that you think other developers would also benefit from.

We 🧡 the people who are involved in this project, and we’d love to help you with onboarding. Drop by the `#contributing` channel on the [Gitpod Discord server](https://www.gitpod.io/chat) and _ask for help_.
