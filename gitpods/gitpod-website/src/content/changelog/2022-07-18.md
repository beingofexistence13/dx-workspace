SSH (secure shell) is a critical protocol for remote development.
Both [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/remote-development-a.html) IDEs and the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview) editor use SSH as their remote development foundation. So, a big focus at Gitpod has been on improving performance and usability for connecting using SSH.

Which is why today **we're excited to announce that in Gitpod you can now upload your own public keys to access your workspace.** In addition, we've also removed the requirement for a mandatory public key to be available when access Gitpod using SSH with an Access Token.
With SSH public key upload you can now:

1. Re-connect to workspaces without needing to go back to the Gitpod dashboard.
2. Benefit from improved security when accessing your workspace with a private key.

See [the announcement post](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/ssh-key-upload) for details on the use-cases, benefits and how to get started using your own key pair with Gitpod today.
