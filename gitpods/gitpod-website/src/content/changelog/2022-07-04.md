During development, sometimes a number of commits occur within a short period of time, which can trigger and queue multiple [prebuilds](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds) for the same branch.

Gitpod will now auto-cancel pending or running prebuilds on the same branch when new commits are pushed, efficiently processing the queue and making sure workspaces always use prebuilds with the latest commits.

Auto-cancellation has been enabled by default for all [projects](https://www.gitpod.io/changelog/introducing-teams-and-projects), but you can disable this behavior in project settings.
