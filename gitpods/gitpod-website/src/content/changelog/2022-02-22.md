Gitpod now restricts access to workspaces opened with [snapshot URLs](/docs/configure/workspaces/collaboration#sharing-snapshots).

> Users must have access to the git repository in the snapshot, in order to open it.

If a snapshot URL user does not have read access to the repo, Gitpod will now show an error message.
Previously, any logged-in Gitpod user could open snapshot URLs for any workspace.

This change matches what happens when users open a new workspace on a private repository, using a prefixed context url. The change also helps to prevent leakage of sensitive or proprietary files via snapshots.
To learn more about collaboration and sharing, please have a look at [our documentation](/docs/configure/workspaces/collaboration)

**Breaking change**

This change may impact you if you are intentionally sharing a private repository using a snapshot, say for an interview.

**Workarounds**

-   Use a public repository instead of a private one.
-   Invite users to the private repository (or to the team on the org) as collaborators.
-   Share a [running workspace](/docs/configure/workspaces/collaboration#sharing-running-workspaces) instead of a snapshot URL.

**Feedback**

As always, please [contact Gitpod](/contact/support) if you have any feedback to share with us.
