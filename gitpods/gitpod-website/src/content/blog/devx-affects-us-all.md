### Key take-home messages

Brittney started her tech journey learning React on[ FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and Udemy. She’s been recognised in several communities for her contributions and for being one of the first to finish[ the complete react developer by zero to mastery course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-native-mobile-development-zero-to-mastery-with-hooks/). Today, she focuses mostly on Svelte. Her story was particularly interesting coming as all got into tech in different ways and learned in different ways too!

Relating to developer experience, the onboarding into the tech world is constantly evolving. For example, in the past developers would learn from books but today there are videos, playgrounds and more! Simply put, _“We’re all in the business of developer experience”_ Brittney shared. No matter what your role is, DevX affects us all from education to developer productivity.

Closely related, DevX improves end user experience as it will allow developers to ship more, build faster and focus on other tasks. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) once again received a shoutout for their brilliant developer experience. Brittney also commented on how she believes that the future of developer experience lies in automating as much of the developer lifecycle as possible which will boost all the developer productivity benefits.

This week’s shoutout by our guest is [Svelte Sirens](https://sveltesirens.dev/) - a place for women and non-binary folks to learn about Svelte and the [JAMStack Community](https://jamstack.org/community/). Don’t forget to check them out!
