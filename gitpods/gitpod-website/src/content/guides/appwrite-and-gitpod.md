Working with Docker gives developers the ability to develop and deploy applications of all types locally without adding dependencies and binaries to their local development environment. Using Docker is used throughout the development lifecycle for fast, easy, and portable application development.

Appwrite uses Docker to make spinning up multiple services as quickly as possible in a self-hosted environment, but we’re always looking at ways to give developers who are less familiar with Docker ways to try Appwrite. This is where Gitpod comes in. Gitpod is one way to combine the power of Docker and Appwrite together to get started quickly. This post shows you how to use Appwrite and Gitpod together to spin up a REST API with database access, authentication, storage, and more without installing anything on your local computer.

Gitpod is a platform that helps you spin up fresh, automated developer environments for each task, in the cloud, in seconds. The vision of Gitpod is to remove all friction from the developer experience & bring back joy and speed to developers' workflows.

The goal of Appwrite is to make getting started and scaling with application development as quickly as possible. Traditionally, you would need to install Docker on your local machine to run Appwrite. Now with Appwrite and Gitpod, you can spin up Appwrite instances for multiple projects with a couple of steps!

We’ve set up a template repo with Gitpod and Appwrite together. You can start a new developer environment with this button:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/appwrite/integration-for-gitpod)

You can also check out our demo application built with Gitpod, Appwrite, and Svelte: https://github.com/appwrite/demo-todo-with-svelte

Just click the “Open in Gitpod” button, log in to GitHub and you’ll be up and running! You can also fork the repo and customize it even further! 👏

We look forward to integrating more with Gitpod in the future! Check out the Gitpod homepage for more information and new development environment templates. Follow @appwrite and @gitpod on Twitter for more updates!
