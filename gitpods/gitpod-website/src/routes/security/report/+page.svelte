	<h1 class="h2 text-center">Security Vulnerability Disclosure Policy</h1>

	<h2 class="mx-0 my-8 h3">Introduction</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Gitpod GmbH welcomes feedback from security researchers and the general
		public to help improve our security. If you believe you have discovered
		a vulnerability, privacy issue, exposed data, or other security issues
		in any of our assets, we want to hear from you. This policy outlines
		steps for reporting vulnerabilities to us, what we expect, what you can
		expect from us.
	</p>
	<h2 class="mx-0 my-8 h3">Systems in Scope</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">
		This policy applies to any digital assets owned, operated, or maintained
		by Gitpod GmbH:
	</p>
	<ul class="pl-xx-small md:pl-x-small space-y-4 mb-4">
		<li><code>io.gitpod.*</code></li>
		<li><code>com.gitpod-staging.*</code></li>
		<li><code>com.gitpod-dev.com.*</code></li>
	</ul>
	<h2 class="mx-0 my-8 h3">Out of Scope</h2>
	<ul class="pl-xx-small md:pl-x-small space-y-4 mb-4">
		<li>
			Assets or other equipment not owned by parties participating in this
			policy.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Vulnerabilities discovered or suspected in out-of-scope systems should
		be reported to the appropriate vendor or applicable authority.
	</p>
	<h2 class="mx-0 my-8 h3">Our Commitments</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">
		When working with us, according to this policy, you can expect us to:
	</p>
	<ul class="pl-xx-small md:pl-x-small space-y-4 mb-4">
		<li>
			Respond to your report promptly, and work with you to understand and
			validate your report;
		</li>
		<li>
			Strive to keep you informed about the progress of a vulnerability as
			it is processed;
		</li>
		<li>
			Work to remediate discovered vulnerabilities in a timely manner,
			within our operational constraints; and
		</li>
		<li>
			Extend Safe Harbor for your vulnerability research that is related
			to this policy.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="/security/thanks">Publically acknowledge</a> your security research
			if responsibily disclosed.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 class="mx-0 my-8 h3">Our Expectations</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">
		In participating in our vulnerability disclosure program in good faith,
		we ask that you:
	</p>
	<ul class="pl-xx-small md:pl-x-small space-y-4 mb-4">
		<li>
			Play by the rules, including following this policy and any other
			relevant agreements. If there is any inconsistency between this
			policy and any other applicable terms, the terms of this policy will
			prevail;
		</li>
		<li>Report any vulnerability you’ve discovered promptly;</li>
		<li>
			Avoid violating the privacy of others, disrupting our systems,
			destroying data, and/or harming user experience;
		</li>
		<li>
			Use only the Official Channels to discuss vulnerability information
			with us;
		</li>
		<li>
			Provide us with a reasonable amount of time (at least 90 days from
			the initial report) to resolve the issue before you disclose it
			publicly;
		</li>
		<li>
			Perform testing only on in-scope systems, and respect systems and
			activities which are out-of-scope;
		</li>
		<li>
			If a vulnerability provides unintended access to data: Limit the
			amount of data you access to the minimum required for effectively
			demonstrating a Proof of Concept; and cease testing and submit a
			report immediately if you encounter any user data during testing,
			such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Personal
			Healthcare Information (PHI), credit card data, or proprietary
			information;
		</li>
		<li>
			You should only interact with test accounts you own or with explicit
			permission from the account holder; and
		</li>
		<li>Do not engage in extortion.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 class="mx-0 my-8 h3">Official Channels</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Please report security issues via security@gitpod.io or using the <a
			href="https://www.gitpod.io/contact/support?subject=security/"
			>contact form</a
		>, providing all relevant information. The more details you provide, the
		easier it will be for us to triage and fix the issue.
	</p>
	<h2 class="h3 mx-0 my-8">Safe Harbor</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">
		When conducting vulnerability research, according to this policy, we
		consider this research conducted under this policy to be:
	</p>
	<ul class="pl-xx-small md:pl-x-small space-y-4 mb-4">
		<li>
			Authorized concerning any applicable anti-hacking laws, and we will
			not initiate or support legal action against you for accidental,
			good-faith violations of this policy;
		</li>
		<li>
			Authorized concerning any relevant anti-circumvention laws, and we
			will not bring a claim against you for circumvention of technology
			controls;
		</li>
		<li>
			Exempt from restrictions in our Terms of Service (TOS) and/or
			Acceptable Usage Policy (AUP) that would interfere with conducting
			security research, and we waive those restrictions on a limited
			basis; and
		</li>
		<li>
			Lawful, helpful to the overall security of the Internet, and
			conducted in good faith.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="m-4">
		You are expected, as always, to comply with all applicable laws. If
		legal action is initiated by a third party against you and you have
		complied with this policy, we will take steps to make it known that your
		actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your security
		research is consistent with this policy, please submit a report through
		one of our Official Channels before going any further.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Note that the Safe Harbor applies only to legal claims under the
			control of the organization participating in this policy, and that
			the policy does not bind independent third parties.
